Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the State University of Maring√°, in the 8th semester. I'm passionate about solving problems that require creativity and tackling challenges that are slightly complex.
I am a proactive and determined enthusiast, always striving to do exceptional work. I believe teamwork is crucial, as collaborating with fellow developers enriches the problem-solving process.
